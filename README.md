## About
The world was once united by the **World Tree**, where the elements of Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, and Thunder were in perfect harmony. However, the ancient entity Voidheart shattered the balance, breaking the World Tree into Elemental Gems. This led to the world being divided into Five Elemental Regions, each ruled by an elemental leader. 

As the regions battle for control, Voidheart begins to dominate, pushing the world toward destruction. You play as Son, a Memory Wanderer with amnesia, who possesses a Soul Gem capable of absorbing the power of the elements. Son's mission is to restore the World Tree, heal the regions, and defeat Voidheart before it's too late.
